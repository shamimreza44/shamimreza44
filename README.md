Perfect 👍 — thanks for letting me use *all* the context.

That means I’ll combine **your academic path, research goals, project history, and long-term ambitions** (PhD in renewable energy, semiconductor expertise, solar cells, RF/antennas, power electronics, satellites, VLSI, etc.) into one **personal home README** that feels both **professional for academia/industry** and **engaging for GitHub visitors**.

Here’s a **stunning draft README.md** for your home repo:
